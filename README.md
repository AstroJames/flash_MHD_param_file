# Update FLASH parameter files for mean-field MHD turbulence simulations

This code reads and updates parameter files for the CFD code, FLASH, and sets the checkpoint / plot file / particle file dump times to fractions of the turbulent turnover times, as well as sets the mean magnetic field of the simulation for a desired Alfv√©nic Mach number.
